HCL--python-project-color-detection

# Introduction
Before going into the speculations of the project it is important to know the definition of color detection. It is simply the process of identifying the name of any color. It is obvious that humans perform this action naturally and do not put any effort in doing so. While it is not the case for computers.

Human eyes and brain work in co-ordination in order to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in eyes transmit the signal to the brain which in turn recognizes the color. There is no exaggeration in saying that humans have mapped certain lights with their color names since childhood. The same strategy is useful in detecting color names in this project
 
 
 # Output
 This project will detect the colour names with the help of color.csv file and when we double click on the picture to know the color and it shows with RGB values
